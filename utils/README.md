## Key Format in AA_PTM_embedding and AA_PTM_structure

The key should be formatted according to the presence or absence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) as follows:
1. **Full Format:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>|<R Group PTM>|<N Term PTM>|<C Term PTM>`
2. **Missing C Term PTM:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>|<R Group PTM>|<N Term PTM>`.
3. **Missing N Term PTM:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>|<R Group PTM>||<C Term PTM>`.
4. **Missing Both R Group and C Term PTM:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>||<N Term PTM>`.
5. **Missing Both R Group and N Term PTM:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>|||<C Term PTM>`.
6. **Missing Both N Term and C Term PTM:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>|<R Group PTM>`.
7. **Missing All PTMs:** `<Amino Acid one letter code>`.

The key format for AA_PTM_embedding and AA_PTM_structure is adapted based on the presence of PTMs. It begins with the amino acid code, followed by modifications at the R group, N terminus, and C terminus. Specific formats are provided to address cases where certain PTMs are missing, ensuring clarity by indicating absent PTMs with empty slots, such as in the case of a missing N Term PTM. The format is streamlined progressively depending on the absence of PTMs, culminating in just the amino acid code if no PTMs are present.

## Structure in AA_PTM_structure
In the AA_PTM_structure, the term "structure" refers to the specific chemical structure of an amino acid that has been modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs). This chemical structure is depicted using the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation.

## Embedding in AA_PTM_embedding
In the AA_PTM_embedding, the term "embedding" describes the numerical representation of a specific chemical structure, generated by the MolFormer model. These embeddings transform complex chemical structures into a computationally manageable format, capturing essential properties of amino acids modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs). This transformation not only simplifies the analysis of these structures but also enhances the generalization capabilities of other de novo peptide sequencing models across various PTMs.
